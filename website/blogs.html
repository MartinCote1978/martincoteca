                    Follow-up</a>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">In my previous post, "FluxCD GitOps Made Simple: My Journey to Automated
                    Kubernetes Deployments", I mentioned wanting to follow up on how to setup the
                    ConfigMap automatically following GitOps principles. This post discusses the various next steps I
                    took in order to achieve that.

                <p class="blog-excerpt">When I first started exploring GitOps and Kubernetes, the landscape felt a bit
                    overwhelming. I had obviously experienced various automation techniques throughout my years but on
                    Kubernetes, I had heard about automation on Kubernetes and declarative infrastructure, but the
                    practical steps to get there were unclear. This blog post shares my journey implementing FluxCD for
                    GitOps-driven Kubernetes deployments, both locally and in a sandbox environment, and how I
                    structured my repository for clarity and scalability.

                    Scalable GCP + Kubernetes Setup including FluxCD</a>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">Although selected because the company where I work was using it, GitLab has now
                    been my preferred
                    tool for my personal software project to manage my code, build the various artefacts my projects are
                    producing constantly and deliver then continuously to my Kubernetes clusters. One of the main
                    question I had originally was the groups (or "folders" in GitLab from my own perspective) and
                    projects (or again, "git repo" in GitLab) structure to follow so the rest of the setup is easy,
                    simple to maintain yet following most of, if not all, the best practices so it can easily integrate
                    with technologies I would adopt along the way.
