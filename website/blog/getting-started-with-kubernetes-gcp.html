                <p>Lessons Learned Deploying Kubernetes on GCP</p>



                1. Introduction

                Brief overview of the project goal: building a secure, multi-service SaaS architecture on GCP using
                Kubernetes.
                Why GCP and Kubernetes? (scalability, managed services, DevOps culture)
                Mention the tech stack: GKE, FluxCD, Istio, Keycloak, OAuth2-proxy, Helm, Terraform, GitLab, etc.
                2. Setting Up the Foundation: VPC, Bastion, and GKE

                Designing the network layout: Shared VPC strategy with limited IP access for security.
                Challenges in initial access:
                SSH access via GCP and from local environments.
                Debate on shared vs individual VM users for the bastion host and your rationale for shared user +
                session recording.
                Terraform modules for VPC, Bastion, and GKE:
                How you structured reusable modules.
                Output dependencies and variable management across stages in CI/CD.
                3. Terraform: Automating Infrastructure

                Why use Terraform for GCP and Kubernetes setup.
                Dealing with GKE logging and monitoring settings via Terraform (e.g., disabling unwanted logging for
                simplicity).
                Avoiding drift: keeping state clean across VPC, GKE, and Bastion modules.
                GitLab pipeline integration: how infra was deployed as a pipeline with Terraform stages.
                4. GitOps with FluxCD

                FluxCD installation without agentk on GitLab.
                Your method of handling Helm charts when GitLab has no built-in Helm registry:
                FluxCD watches chart changes and image updates through GitLab pipelines.
                Using image automation and HelmRelease triggers to drive deployments.



                5. Securing the Cluster
                6. Observability and Monitoring
                7. Managing Multi-Service SaaS Architecture
                8. Real-World Lessons & Gotchas
                9. Future Work & Improvements

                10. Conclusion
                Summary of your architecture and journey.
                What you'd do differently if starting from scratch.
                Encouragement for others embarking on a similar path.



                <p>This is the introduction paragraph of your blog post. It should provide a brief overview of what the
                    reader can expect to learn from this article.</p>

                <h2>First Section</h2>
                <p>Your content goes here. This is where you'll write the main body of your blog post. You can include
                    multiple paragraphs, code examples, and other content.</p>

                <h3>Subsection</h3>
                <p>You can organize your content with subsections as needed. This helps readers navigate through longer
                    articles.</p>

                <pre><code>// Example code block
const example = "This is how you can include code snippets";
console.log(example);</code></pre>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Wrap up your blog post with a conclusion that summarizes the key points and provides any final
                    thoughts or next steps for the reader.</p>
